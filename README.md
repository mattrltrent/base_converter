## CLI base converter in rust 

### Notes

Built one evening because I wanted a quick way to convert between bases for uni classes. Conversions work with any numbers with bases 2-36.

Technically, yes, you can use `bc` to do this too â€” but my program walks you through how to get the solution with detailed steps, and it was kinda fun to make.

Currently, runs with `cargo run <args>`, but I'll clean this up soon. Haven't really polished it either yet, heh.

### Commands (assuming `convert` is root command)

`convert help` -> Opens help menu
`convert table` -> Displays the table used for converting between bases
`convert A B C` -> Converts string A of base B to a new string of base C
`convert A B C --explain` -> Does the same as above, **with the addition of an in-depth explanation**
